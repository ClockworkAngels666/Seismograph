"""Case studies: what the index said the year before major political shocks.

The verdict is mechanical and uses only the index for the year before the event, so it can be checked:
- Flagged: High or Severe tier, or among the 25 riskiest economies.
- Partly flagged: Elevated tier, among the 50 riskiest, or 5+ points riskier over the three years before.
- Missed: none of these.
An analyst's commentary can be added as case_studies/<key>.md (Markdown); it is shown under the data.
