st.markdown(
    f"""
Indicators come in different units (percent, deaths, months), so each is converted into a **0–100 risk score**:

* **Percentile rank** (most indicators). The riskiest economy in the sample scores 100, the safest 0, and the
  rest are spread evenly between them. Percentiles are robust to outliers — one country with 200% inflation
  does not squash everyone else — but they discard the *size* of gaps between countries.
* **Log scale** (battle deaths per 100k, displacement share). Most countries have zero conflict deaths, so a
  percentile rank would bunch them together in the middle. Instead the score is `log(1 + x)` divided by the
  value at the {config.LOG_CAP_QUANTILE:.0%} percentile of non-zero cases, capped at 100. Zero means zero, and
  scores rise steeply from the first deaths, then flatten.

Direction is handled at this step: for "lower is riskier" indicators (growth, reserves, governance scores) the
ranking is reversed, so 100 always means *most risk*.

* **Pillar score** = the simple average of its indicator scores. A pillar needs at least
  {config.PILLAR_MIN_SHARE:.0%} of its indicators; otherwise it is left blank rather than guessed.
* **Composite score** = the weighted average of the pillar scores, with weights rescaled over the pillars that are
  available. A country needs at least {config.COMPOSITE_MIN_PILLARS} of 4 pillars to be ranked.
* **Data coverage** (shown on every profile) is the share of the {len(config.SCORED_INDICATORS)} indicators available.
* An arithmetic mean lets a strength in one pillar offset a weakness in another. That suits a broad screening
  tool; a system focused on crisis risk might prefer a geometric mean, which penalises one very weak pillar more

* **Perception-based governance data.** The WGI aggregate expert and survey perceptions, with real margins of error.
  The WGI authors publish the six dimensions separately and do not combine them; combining them into a pillar here is
  a deliberate, documented choice.
* **Relative scoring.** Percentiles show position, not distance. A global shock that worsens every country can leave
  the ranking unchanged.
* **Missing data.** Small states and countries in conflict often have the least data — exactly where risk is highest.
  Check the coverage figure before drawing conclusions.
