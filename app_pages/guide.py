* **Fast-moving events.** Annual data cannot see last week's coup or last night's protest — read the news pulse,
  official advice and local sources.
* **Relative, not absolute.** A *Low* score means "safer than most", not "safe"; a global shock can leave rankings
  unchanged while every country gets worse. The red flags cover the absolute side.
* **National averages.** A country score hides regions: a conflict in one province may not touch the capital, and
  the reverse.
* **Missing data.** Countries with little data are often the riskiest — check the coverage figure on each profile.
* **Not advice.** This guide describes what such conditions usually mean and how people commonly respond. It is
  general and educational, not investment, legal or security advice.
