1. **Write quarterly assessments** for 5–10 countries in one region and track how your ratings compare with what happened.
2. **Benchmark the index** against the Fragile States Index or OECD classification: where do they disagree, and why?
3. **Add a conflict-events map** with a free UCDP access token or an ACLED account.
4. **Back-test**: compute the index for earlier years and check whether high scores preceded coups, defaults or mass protest.
5. **Add a sanctions pillar** from OpenSanctions or official lists for a compliance angle.
